- [Lambda runtime API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/runtimes-api.html)

This folder contains a bash script `runtime.sh`, which compares the time to retrieve an event from the Lambda runtime and send
the response to it.

This bash script uses gdate which you need to install in MacOS via Homebrew `brew install coreutils`
